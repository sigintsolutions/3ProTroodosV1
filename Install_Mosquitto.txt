How to Install Mosquitto MQTT Broker/Server on Ubuntu 16.04
Prerequisites
An Ubuntu 16.04 server with root access
Open port TCP:1883 on firewall

Step One: Install Mosquitto Broker
Update Ubuntu's package list and install the latest Mosquitto Broker available from it

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mosquitto
The Mosquitto service will start after installation.

Step Two: Install the Clients and Test
Install MQTT clients
sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients
Mosquitto clients help us easily test MQTT through a command line utility. We will use two command windows, one to subscribe to a topic named "test" and one to publish a message to it.

Topics are labels used by the broker to filter messages for each connected client. A client program subscribed to a topic "Home1/BedroomTemp" will only listen to messages published to the same topic by other clients.

Subscribe to topic "test"
mosquitto_sub -t "test"
Mosquito_sub is a subscribe client we installed in the previous command. Here we are specifying "-t" followed by a topic name.

Publish a message to topic "test"
Login to the terminal as a second instance and publish a message to the "test" topic.

mosquitto_pub -m "message from mosquitto_pub client" -t "test"
Here the additional parameter "â€“m" is followed by the message we want to publish. Hit "Enter" and you should see a message from mosquitto_pub client displayed in other terminal where mosquito_sub client is running.

Step Three: Secure with a Password
Mosquitto comes with a password file generating utility called mosquitto_passwd.

sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd dave
Password: password
Create a configuration file for Mosquitto pointing to the password file we have just created.

sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/default.conf
This will open an empty file. Paste the following into it.

allow_anonymous false
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd
Save and exit the text editor with "Ctrl+O", "Enter" and "Ctrl+X".

Now restart Mosquitto server and test our changes.

sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
In the subscribe client window, press "Ctrl+C" to exit the subscribe client and restart it with following command.

mosquitto_sub -t "test" -u "dave" -P "password"
Note the capital -P here.

In the publish client window, try to publish a message without a password.

mosquitto_pub -t "test" -m "message from mosquitto_pub client"
The message will be rejected with following error message.

Connection Refused: not authorised.
Error: The connection was refused.
Now publish a message with the username and password.

mosquitto_pub -t "test" -m "message from mosquitto_pub client" -u "dave" -P "password"
Hit "Enter" and you will see the message in subscribe client window, as in Step Two.
